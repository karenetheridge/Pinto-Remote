    Added the 'statistics', 'pin' and 'unpin' commands.  These
    are identical to the ones in pinto-admin.  You need to 
    run Pinto::Server 0.027 or newer to use these commands.

    The 'list' command now supports the -p and -d options to limit the
    listing to packages or distributions that match a PATTERN.

    No new functionality.  Just updating the code to match the latest
    Pinto API.  Pinto and Pinto::Remote are both evolving rapidly.  I
    make no promises about compatibility.

    Added the 'ping' command, which does a Nop on the remote
    repository.  Use this to check if your remote repository is alive.

    * Bug Fixes:

    The "list" command had become broken because i forgot
    to import List::MoreUtils.  I'm surprised it compiled at all.

    * Interface changes:

    The --host option is now called --server or just -s.

    If you forget to put http:// in front of your server
    name, pinto-remote will kindly do it for you.

    * Other Changes:

    Now requires Pinto-Common 0.019, which has the
    Pinto::Constants library.

    No interface changes.

    Just cleaned up some extra newlines in the output.

    pinto-remote[1] is now zero-conf.  However, you must
    always specify the --host on the command line.

    Added support the different types of "list" actions.

    Only compatible with pinto-server 0.017 or higher.
