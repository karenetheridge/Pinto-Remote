Support some kind of verbose mode, so you can see more of what
happened, not just errors.

Read the HTTP response as a stream and display it progressively, so
users can see the response as it happens, rather than having to wait
until it is all done.  This will require pinto-server to send the
response progressively too.

Find way to share more code between Pinto::Admin and Pinto::Remote.
